# DeepKidney
A geometric deep learning approach to the kidney exchange matching problem.

## Background
Contained within this repository is code that generates data (compatibility graphs), an implementation of Graph Neural Networks using PyTorch Geometric, and Monte Carlo Tree Search. There are several notebooks included to get you started on the basics, such as the format of the random compatiblity graphs and how to use the MCTS algorithm.
